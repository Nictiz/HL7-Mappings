<!-- Purpose: add Narrative to a FHIR resource. Returns the FHIR resource as-is with DomainResource.text inserted in the supported places

    1. Processes all resources in Bundles and Lists too
    2. Skips any contained resource (invariant dom-1) - https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/domainresource-definitions.html#DomainResource.text
    3. Leaves any pre-existing text alone unless they are of type generated or extensions AND parameter $override = 'true'
    4. Known extensions and modifierExtensions are processed
    5. No external calls are made to resolve anything. This means that references should have a display and codes a display. Fallback is implemented
    6. For a number of FHIR code systems on required bindings, translations have been added, otherwise fallback to the code
    
    TODO: build more generic support for (modifier)Extensions
