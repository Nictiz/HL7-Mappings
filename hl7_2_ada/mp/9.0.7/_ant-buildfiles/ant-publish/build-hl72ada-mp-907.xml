<!-- Apache ANT build file that sets up (target = setup) or by default converts transaction with references to full ada xml (target = resolve-refs)
    Apache ANT is based on Java and may be found here: https://ant.apache.org/
    run on command line or from a batch file: 
        ant [-f build.xml] [target]
        
    If you just run ant, it expects a build.xml in the working dir and runs the default target.
